## How to use:
You can enable/disable which keys will be pressed from the GUI, or with a shortcut by pressing <kbd>CTRL</kbd> + <kbd>key_to_spam</kbd>.
The keys are pressed only when you are in the Dota 2 window.
While the <kbd>CTRL</kbd> button is held pressed, none of the keys is pressed in game.

## In order to run it:
 - Download [Java 8](https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp) (or higher) if you haven't already
